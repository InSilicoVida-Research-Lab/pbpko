## Project Origins

### Background

The PBPKO project was initiated in response to the growing need for standardized terminology in physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling. The lack of consistent vocabulary across different PBPK modeling tools and research groups was identified as a barrier to:

- Model interoperability
- Reproducible research
- Knowledge sharing
- Regulatory submissions

### Initial Development

**Project Initiation:**
- Started by IISPV team in collaboration with WUR and JSI
- Focus on creating comprehensive PBPK ontology
- Integration with existing biomedical ontologies
- Community-driven development approach

**Early Challenges:**
- Defining scope and boundaries
- Establishing naming conventions
- Creating consistent definitions
- Building community support

## Key Developments

### Technical Milestones

**Ontology Structure:**
- Hierarchical class organization
- Property relationship definitions
- Import management system
- Validation framework

**Development Tools:**
- ROBOT template system
- Automated build process
- Continuous integration
- Quality assurance procedures

**Documentation:**
- Comprehensive user guides
- Developer documentation
- API documentation
- Tutorial materials

### Community Milestones

**Adoption:**
- First external users
- Community feedback integration
- User group formation
- Conference presentations

**Collaboration:**
- Academic partnerships
- Industry collaborations
- Regulatory engagement
- International cooperation

## Evolution of Scope

### Initial Scope (v1.0.0)
