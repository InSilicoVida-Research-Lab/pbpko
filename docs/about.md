# About PBPKO

## Overview

The Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetic Ontology (PBPKO) is a comprehensive ontology designed to support the modeling and understanding of pharmacokinetics in biological systems. PBPKO provides a standardized vocabulary and conceptual framework for describing physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models, their components, and the biological processes they represent.

## Purpose and Scope

PBPKO aims to:

- **Standardize terminology** used in PBPK modeling across different research groups and software platforms
- **Enable interoperability** between different PBPK modeling tools and databases
- **Support model annotation** with semantic metadata for better reproducibility
- **Facilitate knowledge discovery** through structured representation of PBPK concepts
- **Enable automated reasoning** about PBPK model components and relationships

## Key Features

### Comprehensive Coverage

PBPKO covers the essential components of PBPK modeling:

- **Core Model Classes**: PBPK models, compartments, transporters, and enzymes
- **Biological Processes**: Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME)
- **Parameter Types**: Physiological, physicochemical, and biochemical parameters
- **Output Metrics**: Concentration profiles, pharmacokinetic parameters, and evaluation metrics

### Ontological Foundation

PBPKO is built on solid ontological foundations by importing:

- **Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)** for upper-level categories
- **Relation Ontology (RO)** for standard relationships
- **Gene Ontology (GO)** for biological processes
- **Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI)** for investigation-related terms
- **Systems Biology Ontology (SBO)** for biochemical parameters

### ROBOT-Based Development

The ontology is developed using ROBOT (ROBOT is an OBO Tool) framework, which provides:

- Template-based term generation
- Automated reasoning and validation
- Consistent annotation patterns
- Integration with OBO Foundry standards

## Target Users

PBPKO is designed for:

- **PBPK Modelers**: Researchers developing and using PBPK models
- **Software Developers**: Building PBPK modeling tools and platforms
- **Database Curators**: Managing PBPK model repositories
- **Regulatory Scientists**: Evaluating PBPK models for regulatory submissions
- **Ontologists**: Extending and maintaining the ontology

## Applications

PBPKO can be used for:

- **Model Annotation**: Adding semantic metadata to PBPK models
- **Tool Integration**: Enabling interoperability between modeling platforms
- **Knowledge Discovery**: Finding related models and parameters
- **Quality Assurance**: Validating model completeness and consistency
- **Education**: Teaching PBPK concepts through structured vocabulary

## Development Status

PBPKO is actively developed and maintained by a collaborative team from:

- **IISPV** (Institut d'Investigació Sanitària Pere Virgili)
- **WUR** (Wageningen University & Research)
- **JSI** (Jožef Stefan Institute)

The ontology follows OBO Foundry principles and is designed for long-term sustainability and community adoption.
